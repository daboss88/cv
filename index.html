                <br>
                <p>I am a Computer Science graduate with extensive work experience as a product lead engineer at an SME.
                    The responsibilities I am entrusted with include marketing and sales(which make up 80% of my tasks) and IT
                    functions (e.g. website, user support).</p>
                <p>I am willing to travel for work as my current employment involves frequent travelling for the purpose of attending
                    to and providing training as well as attending queries raised by customers, contractors and/or resellers.
                    In other words, I am a generalist that is willing to learn something new to complete any given task.
                    While I am grateful my current job vastly improved my soft skills, I would like to return to the IT industry
                    where more of my hard skills can come into play, venturing into roles such Data Science / Data Analyst or any
                    other suitable role.</p>
